Bookmark-Manager - part 1
===
This was the Week 4 tutorial from Makers Academy. I was pairing with Maciek on this exercise and this repository is what we did during the first day.

We then decided to completely restart from scratch the next day. This next repository is available on this [link](https://github.com/maciejk77/bookmark_manager2).
